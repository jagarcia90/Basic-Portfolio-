                        Hey everyone! My name is Jorge Garcia, I am originally from Michoacan Mexico but I have called California my home fo the past 24 years. I am currently working as the Assistant Director of Recrutiment for UC Davis Undergarduate Admissions, but this was not always my plan. Apart from currently working for UC Davis, I am also an alumn of UC Davis. I started to work in undergaduate admissions as a segway from the Early Acdemic Outreach Program (EAOP). 
                    </p>

						Grumpy Cat's popularity originated from a picture posted to the social news website Reddit by Bundesen's brother Bryan on September 22, 2012. It was made into an image macro with grumpy captions. As of March 14, 2016, "The Official Grumpy Cat" page on Facebook has over 8.5 million likes. Grumpy Cat was featured on the front page of The Wall Street Journal on May 30, 2013, and on the cover of New York magazine on October 7, 2013.

						In August 2015 it was announced that Grumpy Cat would get her own animatronic waxwork at Madame Tussauds in San Francisco. Tardar Sauce has a twin brother named Pokey, who sometimes also appears in Tardar Sauce's memes.
